## **RGA: Shaping the Future of Artificial Intelligence & Robotics**

### **About RGA**
At RGA, we're not just a company; we're an innovation powerhouse. Standing shoulder to shoulder with global giants like Apple and Tesla, we're far from your typical start-up. Our essence lies in deep technology, fueling our pursuit to revolutionize human-machine interactions.

Our vision is simple, yet profound: Develop cutting-edge social robots based on world-class AI and engineering. These aren't just robots to wash your dishes or do your laundry; we envision companions capable of intellectual and emotional connections. Are robots mere slaves in our imagination, or can they be more? Every day at RGA, we take a step closer to answering that.

We're not just building a company; we're ushering in a new era. We've secured Series B level funding, ensuring continuous projects and a stable future. And we want you to be a part of this journey.

_"Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?"_ Steve Jobs posed this question to John Sculley, PepsiCo's then CEO. What are you building? Maybe it's time to rethink.
