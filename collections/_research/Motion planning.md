## Motion Planning
  - Identifying terrain features in various environments, estimating its own location, and selecting optimized paths and actions to the destination.
  
  - Capable of moving across a variety of terrains, unlike wheeled robots.
  
  - Utilizes perceived information and map data to plan routes. Decides on the optimal path, direction of movement, etc.
  
  - Walks at appropriate speeds adjusted to the surrounding environment.
  
  - Detects potential collision risks based on perceived information and takes appropriate measures to avoid them.
  
  - Maintains a safe distance from moving objects in the vicinity while walking.
