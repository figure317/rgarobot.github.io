## Biomimetic Structure Robot Design
  - Designing a robot body that mimics biological joints.

  - Implementing natural and diverse robot postures.

  - Multi-joint structure that increases energy efficiency during walking.

## Developing motors capable of withstanding high loads.
  - Integrating cooling systems in motors for temperature management and product stability.

  - Using efficient materials to achieve high torque relative to motor size.

  - Utilizing motor drives for current, voltage, torque, speed, and position control, and to prevent motor overload.
