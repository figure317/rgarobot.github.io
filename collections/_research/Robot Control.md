## Stability through a real-time control system.
  - Agile walking control through fast and accurate communication between the control system and motor drives.
  
  - Quick balance recovery in case of impacts or falls.

## Natural Walking
  - Natural walking on various terrains through deep reinforcement learning.

  - Robust walking in real life through high-fidelity simulators and parallel learning.

  - Developing natural walking techniques by transplanting deep learning-based motion capture of real animals.
