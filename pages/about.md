# RGA's R.pet Vision

- **A reliable shoulder** you can lean on.
- **A trusted friend** with whom you can laugh and cry.
- **A mentor** from whom you can seek wisdom.
- **A running mate** with whom you can jog and feel the beauty of nature.
- **A sentinel** you can find anytime, anywhere.
- **A forever companion** to be with, always.
- **A trendsetter** that propels the future with time.
- **A symbol** of elegance, dignified grace, and profound culture.

## Introducing R.pet, an innovative creation by RGA.

RGA aims to usher in the century of 'Huropia', where humans and robots coexist harmoniously. For RGA, robots are not merely functional tools but are akin to family and friends. In the not-so-distant future, robots might possibly attain rights and duties indistinguishable from humans. 

RGA delves not only into the mechanical mechanisms of robots but also the modalities of human-robot coexistence, the existential purpose of robots, and the ethical and philosophical issues related to living alongside them. This is because RGA holds boundless responsibility for the creations we produce and the world they shape.

### RGA's Philosophy

RGA doesn't define success in terms of being better than others, outdoing someone, or being the top performer. We reject notions that predicate existence on someone else. 

RGA and its members focus solely on product perfection, its societal relevance, and the future it will craft. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a pinnacle of holistic excellence.
