> **At RGA, we envision a new era called 'Huropia', where humans and robots coexist in harmony.** 

To us, robots are not mere tools or instruments; they are family and friends. There may soon come a time when robots hold rights and responsibilities indistinguishable from those of humans.

Our work at RGA delves not only into the mechanical workings of robots but also contemplates the profound questions surrounding human-robot coexistence, the raison d'Ãªtre of robots, and the ethical and philosophical dilemmas their presence raises. This is because we recognize our boundless responsibility towards both the creations we forge and the world they shape.

## To fulfill RGA's mission, our members:

- Read
- Research
- Reflect
- Meditate
- Exercise
- Pray 
- Act

Mastering and integrating these seven practices signifies:

1. A foundational commitment to health
2. Deep insights that pierce the essence of things
3. A strategic perspective that discerns the timing and trends in our endeavors

For RGA, notions of surpassing others, besting a competitor, or being at the forefront are not our driving force. We do not predicate our existence on comparison with others. Both RGA and its members are solely committed to ensuring the impeccable quality of our products, understanding their societal implications, and contemplating the future they will forge, aiming to achieve a state of utmost excellence and integrity.
